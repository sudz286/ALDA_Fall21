Language - Python V3.7.12
Frameworks used - TensorFlow API V2.0, Matplotlib V3.2.2, numpy V1.19.5 and Pandas V1.1.5
We've utilised Tensorflow's API to build, train and test our neural network. 
We've used python's package manager 'pip' V21.1.3 to install the dependencies mentioned above. 

Steps followed (Assuming you have python and pip installed in your system):\
1.Change to the directory you wish to work in.\
2.Run `pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib` in the command line.\
3.Store the datasets in the same directory and create a python file with the name of your choice.\ 
4.Run the python file using the command `python3 (insert-filename().py` and record the output.\
